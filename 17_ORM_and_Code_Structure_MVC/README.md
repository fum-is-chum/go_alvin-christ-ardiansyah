## (17) ORM and Code Structure MVC
1. ORM is used to help developers convert data between incompatible type systems using OOP languages
2. ORM advantages:
   - Less repetitive query
   - Auto fetch data into ready to use object
   - Simple
   - Has Cache query

   Disadvantages:
   - Add layer in code and cost the overhead process
   - Load un-necessary relationship data
   - Not suitable for complex raw query
   - Not suitable for specific SQL function

3. Code structure is important in order to achieve modular application. Implement separation of concerns. Less conflict on versioning.
MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.
